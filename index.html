        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2 class="mb-3">Overview</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my React development project for CSCI1300! I analyzed the design and functionality of various online platforms and drew inspiration from this to create a functional aggregator interface with React. This application allows users to sort, filter, and select items from a list – this concept is similar to that of an online shopping cart. Below, you will find a competitive analysis of three websites as well as a narrative process of my work in this project.

        <!-- Part 1 -->
        <h2 class="mb-3">Part 1. Competitive Analysis </h2>
            <p> 
                First, I chose 3 different websites with a favoriting function: 
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls"> Amazon Wishlist </a>, 
                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/"> Goodreads</a>, and 
                <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/"> Pinterest</a>. 
                Here, I examined how they organized information that is relevant 
                to the user and how aggregators are used. (Aggregrators are basically 
                lists that keep track of items). 
            </p>

                    <td>High. Users can make boards for their various interests and add private notes to pins, and make it visually appealing</td>

                    <td>Medium. The options are quite sophisticated with many different tags, but might be visually overwhelming with too many categories.</td>
                    <td>Medium. There are sections within boards, which function as boards within boards. To the average user, this may not be necessary and in fact may make the interface feel clunky</td>

                    <td>High. Users can choose whether to set their Wishlist to private or public and dshare it with people, and navigation for this setting is intuitive</td>
                    <td>Low/None - Goodreads has claimed that this is by design since Goodreads is a social app.</td>
                    <td>High. Boards can be set to public, private, or shared with specific people. </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="row"> Collaboration </th>

                    <td>Low - shelves are for individual use, but you can see friends' shelves for recommendations</td>
                    <td>High - shared boards are enabled for collaborative editing </td>
                  </tr>

              <p class="mb-2"> The analysis of each website's favoriting function shows us some key insights. Amazon Wishlist has great organization — its filtering options are intuitive and relevant without adding too many unnecessary options. However, the visual aspect of the page is a bit lacking in terms of aesthetic customization. While Goodreads offers a high level of customization and filtering options with its organization, bookshelves aren't collaborative and lack privacy options, which does reinforce the fact that it's intended to be a social app, but this could possibly deter users who prefer more privacy. Finally, Pinterest stands out in visual appeal and intuitiveness, which makes it a great choice for visual planning, though the organization system could be streamlined to avoid unnecessary complexity. In summary, each platform has its strengths, but could all be improved from balancing advanced features with simplicity to cater to a broader audience. </p>
              <p class="mb-2"> Based on factors and designs that worked well for these websites, I came up with a list of features that I would like to implement. Intuitive filtering and organization is crucial, so inspired by Amazon Wishlist, I'd like to implement a filtering system based on relevance and easy navigation. There should be categories/tags used for organization which allow users to quickly find items. Also, I want to ensure that the organization remains simple so that users can easily manage their lists without feeling overwhelmed. Finally, the list should be compact and efficient so that users can scan their lists without unnecessary clutter. </p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">Part 2. Implementation </h2>
            <p> For this course, we use Vercel rather than Github pages to deploy React apps from scratch. </p>
            <p> Before getting started on coding, I planned out my interface, which would be centered around the theme of culinary recipes. This app is intended for cooking enthusiasts who want to explore and organize recipes. The aggregator section is called "My Recipe Book" which allows users to save their favorite recipes. This is an important part of the app, designed to show saved recipes with their names, cuisines, and dietary restrictions. It also updates the total number of recipes saved in real-time. Features included are as follows: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <b> 2 filtering categories: </b> Cuisine (Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc) and dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free) </li>
                <li> <b> 1 sorting feature: </b> Preparation time for each recipe </li>
                <li> <b> 1 Aggregator: </b> "My Recipe Book" which displays recipes with the name, cuisine, and dietary restriction/preference. This should also dynamically update the total count of recipes in the book.</li>
                <li> <b> 12 Item cards: </b> Each recipe card should show the recipe name, cuisine & dietary restrictions (for filtering), preparation time (for sorting). There should also be a button to save or remove recipes from "My Recipe Book" depending on whether they have already been added. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> I made a mockup of what the webapp would look like on Figma, which can be found below. </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-5">
                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FY2EjA0gXOFoCBFd9CqfYQU%2FCS1300-Development%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DrOJkqJ8zW7AxeYLC-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p> Then, I proceeded to code up the application then deploy it using Vercel, which can be found <a href="https://cs1300-development-mu.vercel.app/">here</a>. I have also ensured that I followed proper accessibility principles, such as including alt text for every picture and focusing on appropriate color contrast. Using the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool also showed no accessibility issues. Finally, this page yielded a score of 100 on Lighthouse's accessibility report.  </p>
            <div class="row mb-5">
                <div class="col">
                    <img src="assets/wave.png" class="img-fluid" alt="wave accessibility evaluation report">
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <img src="assets/lighthouse.png" class="img-fluid" alt="lighthouse">
                </div>

            </div>

            <p> As you can see, there are a few slight differences in terms of visual presentation. As I went through the process of coding and testing out the app, I found that there were certain visual changes that allowed for easier use and viewing. Overall, this project allowed me to practice using React and reinforced the importance of concepts that we've learned in the course so far, such as user-centered design and accessibility in web development. It was a valuable learning experience in applying theoretical knowledge to create a functional web application.
