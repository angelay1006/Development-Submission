        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2 class="mb-3">Overview</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my React development project for CSCI1300! I analyzed the design and functionality of various online platforms and drew inspiration from this to create a functional aggregator interface with React. This application allows users to sort, filter, and select items from a list â€“ this concept is similar to that of an online shopping cart. Below, you will find a competitive analysis of three websites as well as a narrative process of my work in this project.

        <h2 class="mb-3">Part 1. Competitive Analysis </h2>
            <p> 
                First, I chose 3 different websites with a favoriting function: 
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls"> Amazon Wishlist </a>, 
                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/"> Goodreads</a>, and 
                <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/"> Pinterest</a>. 
                Here, I examined how they organized information that is relevant 
                to the user and how aggregators are used. (Aggregrators are basically 
                lists that keep track of items). 
            </p>

                    <td>Medium. Users can create multiple wishlists for different purposes and add any item. However, visual design options are limited </td>
                    <td>High. It's easy to add items to lists and manage them directly from product or list pages</td>
                    <td>High. Users can make boards for their various interests and add private notes to pins, and make it visually appealing</td>

                    <td>Medium. There is a list and grid view offered but can be confusing with too many options</td>
                    <td>High. Intuitive design with different views and a large noticeable "organize" label. </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="row"> Organization </th>
                    <td>High. The options to sort by are relevant, such as being purchased or unpurchased, or level of price and priority. </td>
                    <td>Medium. The options are quite sophisticated with many different tags, but might be visually overwhelming with too many categories.</td>
                    <td>Medium. There are sections within boards, which function as boards within boards. To the average user, this may not be necessary and in fact may make the interface feel clunky</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
